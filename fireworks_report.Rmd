Showing the sales per day and per type. Steady sale thorugh the month, real ramp up of sales in the last few days near the event when people would have a better idea of the whether.


# Sales by Location

Location have been determined by the postcode give, and will be where the payment card is addressed. Will have some like students can be living in Stirling but their card is registered to another home address. The Glasgow COP26 was happening at the same time so we will have had more people from outside of the area staying in hotel.

Sales broken down to postcode area, shows the main bulk has come from Stirling, Falkirk and Alloa areas. We would lose some if not all of these next bonfires night when Falkirk and Alloa look to restart there fireworks.

Filtering down to our normal table area of Dunblane, Bridge of Allan and Stirling area is 812 out of 1720 sales about 47%. We would have some over lap with other areas. We had about 1500 sales from the FK postcode areas about 82% of our sales that we could see some of them again.

Both our normal areas and other areas are similar in the spread of the types of tickets.
